# MUD-task2

In this repository two sessions are available: session 2 and session 4. Each of them containing the follwing projects:

-Session 2: Drug tagging from a drug dataset. By adding fratures and using different models, we are able to recognize commercial drugs, either by name or                   formula, with accuracies up to 60%

-Session 4: Relation tagging. By adding features to tokens and using different models, we are able to detect relations between words, with accuracies up to 40%.

The MUD Laboratories pdf contains the project presentation together with results and our conclusions about them. In .stats files, statistics about each model results are presented and the extract_features file, contains the feature creation and management.
